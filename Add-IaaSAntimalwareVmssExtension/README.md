# Add-OMSAgentVmssExtension.ps1

Microsoft Antimalware provides free real-time protection against viruses, spyware and other malicious software. The solution is built on the same antimalware platform as Microsoft Security Essentials, Forefront Endpoint Protection, System Center Endpoint Protection, Windows Intune and Windows Defender. Microsoft Antimalware is a single-agent malware protection for tenant environments.
